            </h2>
            <p>
                I am a Graduate Research Scholar at Tsinghua University specializing in quantum algorithms and their applications in physics. My research focuses on Hamiltonian simulation (including SQD and Krylov time-evolution) and computational methods for differential equations. I am also exploring the intersection of physics and AI through quantum machine learning and Hamiltonian-based embedding methods.<br><br>
                My academic journey has been shaped by research experience at DRDO and mentorship under Dr. Xiongfeng Ma, Dr. Amitansu Pattanaik, and Dr. Kathiravan Srinivasan.<br><br>
                Beyond the lab: I am an amateur radio astronomer. I operate a personal 3-meter radio dish for pulsar detection currently I am trying to develop custom algorithm to isolate deep-space signals from PSR B0329+54 Pulsar.

                        <strong>Machine learning and quantum approaches for particle tracking at the HL-LHC.</strong><br>
                        This project explores scalable solutions for reconstructing particle trajectories from detector data, as posed in the CERN TrackML challenge. It covers the evolution from graph neural networks (GNN) for edge classification, to hybrid pipelines that combine deep learning with classical physics-based methods, and finally to a quantum approach using Hamiltonian optimization and quantum annealing for global track assignment. The page includes technical explanations, open-source code, and a full project report for those interested in high-energy physics, machine learning, or quantum computing.

                            <strong>Reliability Analysis of Dynamic Surface Code Deformation</strong><br>
                            This project investigates the reliability of quantum information encoded using the surface code, focusing on the impact of spatially correlated faults—such as those induced by ionizing radiation—on logical qubit preservation. The study compares static redundancy (high code distance) and dynamic code deformation (temporary reduction in code distance during bursts), quantifies logical error rates under burst faults, and provides design guidance for future quantum hardware. The work uses a rotated surface code lattice, fault injection, and performability metrics to evaluate real-world trade-offs in quantum error correction strategies.
